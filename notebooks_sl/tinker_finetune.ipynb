            "\u001b[0m\u001b[33menron corp. is in advanced discussions to sell its portland general electric utility unit to northwest natural gas co. for about $ 1. 8 billion in cash and stock in a highly leveraged transaction that would eventually give enron a minority stake in northwest, according to people familiar with the matter.\n",
            "\u001b[0m\u001b[33mthe discussions are at a very delicate stage, and some important points need to be finalized, these people caution. the current environment could also make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn't a certainty. however, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could be announced in the next few days. northwest natural is also expected to assume roughly $ 1 billion in debt.\n",
            "\u001b[0m\u001b[33menron and northwest natural declined to comment. if a transaction is consummated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of enron's agreement to sell the utility to sierra pacific resources. that transaction fell apart in part because of the california energy crisis. a purchase of portland general would be a very big bite for northwest natural, which has a market capitalization of just $ 650 million and supplies natural gas to more than 500, 000 residential and business customers in oregon and vancouver, wash. portland general is an electric utility serving more than 1. 4 million customers in oregon. the deal would bring together two oregon utilities whose executives and employees know each other well. richard g. reiten, northwest's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating officer of portland general between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board. by buying a utility, northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when prices are cheap. a deal would be accretive to northwest's earnings, people familiar with the matter say. and the financial risk for northwest natural is somewhat muted because enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transaction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in northwest natural in addition to cash. northwest natural would finance the transaction with debt and equity offerings. shares of northwest natural were trading up $ 1. 04 at $ 25. 99 in 4 p. m. composite trading on the new york stock exchange, while enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $ 33. 10. for enron, a deal with northwest natural would be the latest twist in a five - year ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break into california's deregulating electricity market. but the utility business proved less valuable than anticipated when enron was prevented from selling off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply. and california's market developed serious problems last year that made it a less attractive place for enron to do business. enron, which also owns a major gas - transmission pipeline system, has a history of buying assets and businesses, learning what it can from them, and then selling off the bulk of physical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere. it isn't clear where enron will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale. its broadband telecommunications business is in the doldrums and it recently said it would invest $ 250 million in it this year, down from a formerly projected $ 750 million.\n",

            "\u001b[0m\u001b[33mthe assembly energy costs and availability committee held hearings yesterday on the socal bailout plan, ab 82. the chairman of the committee, rod wright, has agreed with hertzberg and davis to move something out of the committee, possibly by mid - week. much of the assembly's efforts to move along a comprehensive plan have been encumbered by the introduction of over 50 amendments. additionally, demonstrations by a group of farmers and resort owners opposing the conservation easement provision included in the bill may also slow the process.\n",
            "\u001b[0m\u001b[33mthree central valley democrats ( reyes, flores and canciamilla ) on the assembly committee on energy costs and availability will likely be paying close attention to the demonstrations against the conservation easements, as farmers are significant in their districts. all three legislators face reelection. reyes has already signaled that, even though she voted for the bailout last time, she is disinclining to do so again. these three democrats may impede the progress of the bailout. there are strong indications that the plan will not come to a vote until it has the necessary votes to pass. at this point there still appears to be a lack of consensus on the democratic side.\n",
            "\u001b[0m\u001b[33manother substantive amendment to the current plan has been a call by socal for \" fair market value \" of its transmission assets, rather than book value. this value, of course, would have to be estimated and essentially means that even more money would have to go toward the bailout. while committee chairman wright would not oppose this idea, it will likely be hard for many of his colleagues to swallow, particularly on the senate side.\n",
            "\u001b[0m\u001b[33monce the amendments are disposed of and the bailout plan clears the assembly energy costs and availability committee, it will then go to assembly appropriations. the chair of this committee, carol migden, is friendly with both hertzberg and governor davis, so the plan appears unlikely to receive significant opposition in her committee. it will then go to the assembly floor for a vote. since it is likely some sort of bailout plan will pass the assembly, it likely will fall to the senate to decide ultimately if a socal bailout makes it to the governor or not. therefore, it becomes important to examine what deals might be made between burton and davis in order to get a bailout through the senate. for example, burton wants a change in the workers'compensation laws to increase payouts to workers. this is a very important issue. on the one hand, both trial lawyers and the unions support burton. on the other hand, he is strongly opposed by the powerful ctma, the republicans and pro - business democrats, including governor davis. in fact, davis has already vetoed this legislation at least once and has promised to do so again. it is conceivable, though unlikely, that a deal could be struck whereby burton would allow a socal bailout to pass in exchange for davis signing workers'compensation reform. however, if this were to happen, both the bailout and the workers'comp reform together would be an enormous burden on california businesses at a time when these businesses are not doing well. this is why a deal on this particular topic appears unlikely at this time.\n",
